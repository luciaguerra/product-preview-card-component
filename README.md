## My process
It took me a lot of time to find the perfect size for the grid to avoid creating a lot of media queries, which it's still a struggle for me.

This challenge was entertaining and helped me to keep practicing CSS Grid! Also took the time to get better at coding and pay way more attention to every line of code to avoid the design to break easily, which luckily didn't happen this time! Although the design had to be fixed a couple times, but not as many as some of my latest solutions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
